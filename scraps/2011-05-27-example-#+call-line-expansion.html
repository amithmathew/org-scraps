this code block peeks inside of the `params' variable which is used by
babel during code block evaluation
#+source: callee
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; this is cheating and shouldn't be done in user code :)
  (or (cdr (assoc :foo params)) 'unset)
#+end_src

this code block evaluates to the following,
#+results: callee
: unset

this call line,
#+call: callee[:foo bar]() :results org

expands into the following which is evaluated as a normal code block
by Babel.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var results=callee[:foo bar]() :results org
  results
#+end_src

this code block evaluates to the following,
#+results:
#+BEGIN_ORG
nothing
#+END_ORG
