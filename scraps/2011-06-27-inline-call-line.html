** inline call line
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DATE:     2011-06-27
   :END:

#+source: double
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var it=0
  (* 2 it)
#+end_src

This is the number src_sh[:var it=double(it=1)]{echo $it} in the middle

The following exports as a normal call line
#+call: double(it=1)

Now here is an inline call call_double(it=1) stuck in the middle of
some prose.

This one should not be exported =call_double(it=2)= because it is
quoted.

Finally this next one should export, even though it starts a line
call_double(it=3) because sometimes inline blocks fold with a
paragraph.

And, a call with raw results call_double(4)[:results raw] should not
have quoted results.
